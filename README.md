# flan-t5-base-sumsum

A Dockerized environment to Fine-tune FLAN-T5 for chat &amp; dialogue summarization based on the following excellent [blog post](https://www.philschmid.de/fine-tune-flan-t5).

Be sure you have Docker installed and running. 

```bash 
$ docker --version                                           tflan  13:36:08
Docker version 20.10.21, build baeda1f
```

To spin up the notebook environment run

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```
And then go to [http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=passwd](http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=passwd) to access the notebook. 

Happy hacking !
